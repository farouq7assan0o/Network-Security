# Network Security Project

## Overview

This project involves the design, configuration, and security testing of a multi-site enterprise network. The setup includes offices in Amman, Aqaba, Irbid, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey. Key objectives were to implement secure communication through VPN and IPsec, enforce access control with ACLs, segment traffic using VLANs, and ensure high availability and integrity of data and services.

## Topology Summary

- Routers and data centers were configured in Amman and Aqaba
- Remote offices in Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Irbid connected via secure VPN tunnels
- VLAN segmentation used across sites for traffic isolation and role separation
- ACLs applied for controlled access to services
- OSPF routing protocol used throughout the network

## Key Security Implementations

### VPN and IPsec

- Site-to-site VPN tunnels established from Amman to Saudi Arabia and Turkey
- AES encryption with SHA authentication
- Pre-shared keys and ISAKMP policies configured for secure negotiation

### Firewalls and NAT

- ASA firewall configured at Aqaba with:
  - DMZ for public servers
  - NAT policies for static and dynamic translations
  - ACLs for HTTPS and restricted SSH access from HQ only
  - Global service policy for FTP, ICMP, and DNS inspection

### Switch Security

- Port security applied to limit MAC addresses per port
- Unused ports shut down
- SSH enabled for remote management
- VLAN segmentation to isolate services

### Router Hardening

- Password encryption and AAA authentication
- SSH for remote access
- Login blocking and timeout settings
- Access control lists to restrict Telnet, HTTP, and unauthorized access

### DNS, DHCP, FTP, and HTTPS Services

- DHCP security applied to prevent spoofing and starvation
- DNS traffic filtered with ACLs
- HTTPS and FTP services protected with firewall rules and restricted access

## Testing and Validation

- ACLs tested by attempting access from allowed and restricted networks
- SSH access to firewall verified as restricted to HQ only
- AAA authentication tested on Irbid router
- VPN functionality validated via SSH tunnel testing between Turkey and Amman
- Port security and MAC address limits tested on switches
- Routing tested using ICMP to confirm inter-site connectivity

## Hardware and Software Used

- Cisco routers and ASA firewalls
- Cisco Catalyst switches
- Cisco Packet Tracer for simulation
- IOS and ASA OS for configuration
- Windows or Linux-based servers for FTP, DNS, DHCP, and HTTPS

## Design Assessment

- Topology designed to ensure availability, segmentation, and protection
- DMZ, ACLs, and encryption enhance the defense-in-depth strategy
- VPN ensures secure communication between geographically separate offices
- Firewall rules strictly control traffic flow

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

- Deploy intrusion detection and prevention systems
- Schedule regular security audits
- Implement automated update management for firmware
- Expand logging and monitoring capabilities
- Conduct routine staff training on security awareness
